          Luke Greenaway is a freelance web & digital designer based in
          Brighton, UK. He works on a wide spectrum of commercial projects;
          ranging from fully responsive interfaces for web-based products to
          intricate & bespoke designs for a tailored device or audience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a professional, Luke has built up a whole range of industry
          experience from working in house with agencies, collaborating within
          diverse teams, or client-side on a consultancy basis. In 2016, he was
          very fortunate to co-direct a small design boutique before returning
          back to the freelance world where he could continue to partner with
          agencies and brands that value both design and development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Luke has spent the last 12 years working with design & code in
          parallel, becoming a fluent front-end developer in the process. He
          strives to produce digital experiences that are beautiful, purposeful
          and user-friendly.

            By studying and understanding the userâ€™s behaviour, Luke is able to
            architect journeys that enable the user to achieve their desired
            tasks with minimal effort. A good interface should be self
            explanatory and will only succeed if the customer knows
            instinctively how to use it. Luke works to the principle that less
            is more and utilises effective prompts & interactions to help focus
            the user to the areas which will produce conversions.
